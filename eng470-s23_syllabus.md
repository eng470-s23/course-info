## course description
This course offers a supported environment for developing an original, term-length digital research project that brings together the knowledge and skills you have cultivated in the Digital Humanities minor. This capstone project is an opportunity to make a contribution to scholarly research and to develop a porfolio piece that showcases your skills as a digital maker. Whether you choose to create a digital edition, an interactive map, a dynamic timeline, a podcast, a website, a video game, a data dashboard, or something else altogether, you will spend the term brainstorming, planning, designing, prototyping, workshopping, and presenting your work in progress. Ultimately, you will foster and articulate a critical praxis that aligns your technical and design choices with your priorities and values as a maker. 

---
## learning goals
- Conceptualize and prototype a humanities project that leverages digital tools ethically and thoughtfully to preserve, engage with, and produce new knowledge about culture
- Reflect critically on how digital archives, datasets, interfaces, and tools operate, including how they model information, make arguments, and shape user experiences
- Manage digital research materials, outputs, and workflows effectively
- Create project documentation that follows best practices for reproducibility
- Gain or sharpen skills related to troubleshooting, debugging, and problem solving
- Recognize that, in DH, the meaning of your research often lies in the *process* of gathering data, processing your sources, developing your claims, and documenting your choices, moreso than in the resulting digital product  

---
## required materials
You will need access to a laptop computer that you can bring with you to all of our class sessions (if you do not have one, please arrange a loaner through UO). You will also need day-to-day access to Internet with web browser, Canvas, and your UO email account. All assigned readings, videos, etc. are available free to you through the open web, the UO library, and/or our Canvas site. See the weekly modules and the class schedule for access links.

---
## assignments

### major project
Your goal in this class is to conceptualize and prototype a digital project driven by a compelling research question. To scaffold and document the process, you will create a github repository that includes documentation of all your research and decisions over the course of the term. To get started, you'll clone a provided example repo that includes the following templates: 
_readme.md 
_license.md
_project-log.md 
_data-management.md
_presentation.md
_white-paper.md
_config.yml
	
In most cases, the assignment prompt and instructions are built into the template file, and you will comment out or delete those instructions as you replace the provided text with your own work.
	
### weekly milestones (50 points)
Half of your course grade will be based on full, timely completion of each weekly milestone (5 points per week). Milestones are due at the end of the week (Friday at 11:59 p.m.) unless otherwise indicated. 
	
- week 1: Markdown foundations tutorial
- week 2: set up your repository
- week 3: pitch (in _project-log.md)
- week 4: bibliography, search log, and reading plan (in _project-log.md)
- week 5: three annotated bibliography entries and research question (in _project-log.md)
- week 6: remaining annotations, environmental scan (in _project-log.md)
- week 7: data management plan with accessibility checklist (_data-management.md)
- week 8: credits, acknowledgments, license (_readme.md)
- week 9: presentation (_presentation.md or _presentation.ppt)
- week 10: white paper (_white-paper.md), website (_config.yml)
	
### final portfolio (50 points)
The other half of your course grade will consist of a holistic assessment of your final portfolio, which will be a github pages static site launched from your repository. The static site may include within it or link out to your prototype. The quality of the portfolio as a whole is more important than how your digital project prototype itself turns out. 

### extra credit
Extra credit will be available for attending and writing about or presenting on relevant campus events.

## course policies

### attendance 
Regular attendance correlates strongly with higher grades and a better experience in this course. Your presence in class matters for your own learning as well as for the contributions you can make to the learning of others. Attendance is taken at every class meeting using a sign-in sheet passed around within the first five minutes. If you arrive after the sign-in sheet has been passed around, you are responsible for checking in with Prof. B after class to make note of your attendance. Late arrivals are disruptive, and routine or excessive tardiness will be documented as absence.
	
At a bare minimum, you must attend 60% of the class meetings (12 of 20) to pass the class, including the symposium on June 1. Beyond that minimum threshold, attendance is assessed holistically as part of your portfolio grade. Specifically, regular attendance and a consistently high level of engagement will weigh in favor of rounding up if the portfolio grade is borderline. 
		
In compliance with the Provost’s reason-neutral attendance policy, no distinction is made between excused and inexcused absences; in general, there is no need to document the reason for your absence. Please do not send Prof. B. doctors’ notes or offer usolicited personal information. Absences associated with religious observance, official university business, or documented AEC accommodations are exempt from consideration as part of your Ongoing Engagement grade provided that these absences meet the narrow and specific definitions in the student code and that you notify Prof. B in writing and with appropriate official documentation within the first two weeks of the term.
	
If you have to miss class, you are expected to catch up what you missed by reading the shared notes, reviewing any slides or handouts posted to Canvas, and connecting with other students in the class to answer any lingering questions you may have.
	
### late work
Each student has a bank of 4 “late days” (calendar days) to spend on assignments without penalty. You can turn one assignment in four days late, four assignments in one day late each, or somewhere in between. Note that the revised essay and memo are two separate assignments. These penalty-free late days will be automatically applied to late assignments in the order of their due date. 
	
Late work will otherwise not be considered for a grade, except in case of documented AEC accommodations or extreme extenuating circumstances. Everyone gets sick, has family emergencies, etc. at some point, so save your late days for when you really need them.
	
### accessibility	
The professor for this course works hard to create accessible and inclusive learning environments and strives continually to improve. Please notify Professor Burkert if there are aspects of the instruction or design of this course that result in barriers to your participation. You are also encouraged to contact the [Accessible Education Center](https://aec.uoregon.edu/) in 360 Oregon Hall at (541) 346-1155 or email uoaec@uoregon.edu

### student workload
This course is designed to align with the Office of the Provost's [Credit Hour and Student Workload Policies](https://provost.uoregon.edu/credit-hour-and-student-workload-policies-policy), which states: "University policy defines one undergraduate credit hour as approximately 30 real hours of student work, both in class and out of class. Thus, a 4-credit course should engage students for 120 hours over the course of the term." That's about 12 hours per week. 
	
This class meets for 3 hours per week, and you should plan to spend another 2 hours per week, on average, preparing the assigned readings. That's a baseline commitment of 5 hours per week (50 hours total), which leaves 70 hours to work on your project. You should budget a gradually increasing number of hours per week as the term goes on. i.e.: 
- weeks 1-3: 4 hours per week (12 hours)
- weeks 4-6: 6 hours per week (18 hours)
- weeks 7-10: 10 hours per week (40 hours)
	
If you don't have 15 hours per week to spend on this class in weeks 7-10, you should dedicate time early in the term getting a jump on the shared readings that come later. 

You are **strongly** encouraged to log your time spent on this class to ensure that you are on track. You cannot do a 70-hour project in the last few weeks of the term!! 
	
### instructor workload
As research faculty, 40% of Professor Burkert's time is reserved for teaching, to be split across two courses enrolling 60-80 students total. In a 50-hour work week, that amounts to 20 hours. Half of those hours are spent in class and in office hours, leaving 10 hours a week for reviewing the assigned readings, preparing lessons, grading and writing feedback, mentoring and supervising TAs, responding to student emails, and keeping Canvas up-to-date. With this in mind, please use office hours whenever possible for one-on-one meetings; reach out to peers for information about missed classes (and act as a resource to others when they have to miss class); and review the syllabus and assignment prompts carefully for answers to basic logistical questions before sending an email.

---
## technology policies

### electronic devices in the classroom
You may use your phone, tablet, or computer in class to access course readings and materials, take notes, or otherwise support your learning. You may not text message, browse the web, or do work for other courses on your devices during our class sessions. If you are found to be doing so, Professor Burkert will stop class to ask you to put your device away for the remainder of the class session. A repeat offense on a subsequent occasion will result in loss of device use privileges in class for the remainder of the term. If you find the temptation towards distraction overwhelming, consider printing out or buying/borrowing hard copies of the readings, using pen and paper to take notes, and keeping your devices turned off and put away during class.

### privacy
It is your ethical responsibility to respect the legally protected privacy of your classmates and what they share in class and online. It is prohibited to repost, republish, or quote from our class discussions on the web or social media, even if names/identities are anonymized, without the express permission of the instructor and your peers. No personally identifiable information, such as street addresses, phone numbers, or email addresses, should be posted on our course sites or shared note-taking document, nor should any discussion of grades. Any such details arising in the course of class discussion should be redacted from any notes, transcriptions, recordings, etc. to protect against unauthorized access.

### recording of class meetings
You may record or transcribe our class discussions, provided that you 
1. use only UO-licensed or UO-approved software; 
2. store the resulting files locally on your computer and/or in your UO-licensed cloud storage account; and 
3. retain them only for your individual use (as you would handwritten notes). 

To be clear, you may NOT use freemium software like Otter.AI, Descript, ChatGPT, Bard, etc. to process class recordings, as doing so essentially constitutes selling your classmates’ federally protected, private educational records in exchange for access to a product.

### intellectual property
You may reuse, republish, or remix materials created by the professor under the appropriate license provided that you adhere to the indicated terms. For example, this syllabus is published under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial license, meaning you may reuse it in part or in whole provided that you credit the author (Dr. Mattie Burkert) and that you do not sell or make money from the material.
	
You may not reuse, republish, or remix materials produced by other students in this class without their express permission.

Under no circumstances should you sell or give anything produced in or related to this class to third-party companies like Course Hero, Shmoop, etc.

### use of artifical intelligence (AI)
Learning to use artificial intelligence systems (such as ChatGPT and Bard) and to recognize their pluses and minuses are important emerging skills. In the context of this course, however, many potential uses of AI would hinder your achievement of the course learning goals. Therefore, the use of AI systems is allowed in this course only with explicit permission. If permission is given, you will be required to document your use according to guidelines that will be provided.
	
Formal and informal writing submitted for credit toward completion of course requirements must be your own original work done specifically for this course and without substantive assistance from others, including AI systems. Written work suspected of being AI-generated or plagiarized may be submitted to detection tools to ensure it is human-created and original. Please also carefully read the academic integrity policy below concerning plagiarism.
	
This policy is based in part on the resource [“Teaching and AI Systems”](https://teaching.uoregon.edu/teaching-and-ai-systems) from UO’s Teaching Engagement Program, as well as the instructor’s experience last term reading dozens of essays written by English 250 students in collaboration with ChatGPT.

## departmental and university policies

### honoring native peoples and lands
The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya Ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Following treaties between 1851 and 1855, Kalapuya people were dispossessed of their indigenous homeland by the United States government and forcibly removed to the Coast Reservation in Western Oregon. Today, Kalapuya descendants are primarily citizens of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, and they continue to make important contributions to their communities, at UO, and across the land we now refer to as Oregon.

In following the Indigenous protocol of acknowledging the original people of the land we occupy, we also extend our respect to the nine federally recognized Indigenous nations of Oregon: the Burns Paiute Tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Grand Ronde, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs, the Coquille Indian Tribe, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, and the Klamath Tribes. We express our respect to the many more tribes who have ancestral connections to this territory, as well as to all other displaced Indigenous peoples who call Oregon home. 

### basic needs
Your safety and wellbeing impacts learning. Please contact resources that can help you to thrive and let me know if you need any help connecting. Any student who has difficulty affording groceries or accessing sufficient food to eat every day, or who lacks a safe and stable place to live, is urged to contact the Dean of Students Office (346-3216, 164 Oregon Hall) for support. The [UO Basic Needs Resource Guide](https://blogs.uoregon.edu/basicneeds/) also includes resources for food, housing, healthcare, childcare, transportation, technology, finances, and legal support. 

### mental wellbeing
Life in college can be very complicated. Students often feel overwhelmed or stressed, experience anxiety or depression, struggle with relationships, or just need help navigating challenges in their life. If you're facing such challenges, you don’t need to handle them on your own--there's help and support on campus. If your instructor believes you may need additional support, they may express concern and refer you to resources that might be helpful. 

University Health Services help students cope with difficult emotions and life stressors. If you need general resources on coping with stress or want to talk with another student who has been in the same place as you, visit the [Duck Nest](http://health.uoregon.edu/ducknest), located in the EMU on the ground floor, and get help from one of the specially trained Peer Wellness Advocates. [University Counseling Services (UCS)](http://counseling.uoregon.edu/) has a team of dedicated staff members to support you with your concerns, many of whom can provide identity-based support. All clinical services are free and confidential. Find out more by calling 541-346-3227 (anytime UCS is closed, the After-Hours Support and Crisis Line is available by calling this same number).

### academic integrity
The [University Student Conduct Code](https://dos.uoregon.edu/code-procedures) defines academic misconduct. Students are prohibited from committing or attempting to commit any act that constitutes academic misconduct. By way of example, students should not give or receive (or attempt to give or receive) unauthorized help on assignments or examinations without express permission from the instructor. Work completed for previous courses or being developing for other courses this term should not be submitted for this course. Students should properly acknowledge and document all sources of information (e.g. quotations, paraphrases, ideas) and use only the sources and resources authorized by the instructor. If there is any question about whether an act constitutes academic misconduct, it is the students’ obligation to clarify the question with the instructor before committing or attempting to commit the act. [Additional information about a common form of academic misconduct, plagiarism, is available here](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/citing-plagiarism). Cases of clearly established plagiarism or cheating will result in an assignment grade of “0” as a minimum penalty; all incidents will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards, as required by the English Department and University. 

### reporting of discrimination, harassment, and abuse
Any student who has experienced sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender-based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment may seek resources and help at safe.uoregon.edu. To get help by phone, a student can also call either the UO’s 24-hour hotline at 541-346-SAFE [7244]. Students experiencing any other form of prohibited discrimination or harassment can find information and resources at investigations.uoregon.edu or contact the non-confidential Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance at 541-346-3123 or the Dean of Students Office at (541) 346-3216 for help. As UO policy has different reporting requirements based on the nature of the reported harassment or discrimination, additional information about reporting requirements for discrimination or harassment unrelated to sexual assault, relationship violence, sex or gender based bullying, stalking, and/or sexual harassment is available in the [Employee Responsibilities section of the Office of Investigations and Civil Rights Compliance website](https://investigations.uoregon.edu/employee-responsibilities#employee-obligations). 

The instructor of this class, as a Student Directed-Employee, will direct students who disclose sexual harassment or sexual violence to resources that can help and will only report the information shared to the university administration when the student requests that the information be reported (unless someone is in imminent risk of serious harm or a minor). The instructor of this class is required to report all other forms of prohibited discrimination or harassment to the university administration. 

UO employees, including faculty, staff, and GEs, are mandatory reporters of child abuse. This statement is to advise you that your disclosure of information about child abuse to a UO employee may trigger the UO employee’s duty to report that information to the designated authorities; [see here for detailed information about Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse and Neglect](https://hr.uoregon.edu/policies-leaves/general-information/mandatory-reporting-child-abuse-and-neglect).

### academic disruption
In the event of a campus emergency that disrupts academic activities, course requirements, deadlines, and grading percentages are subject to change. Information about changes in this course will be communicated as soon as possible by email, and on Canvas. If we are not able to meet face-to-face, students should immediately log onto Canvas and read any announcements and/or access alternative assignments. Students are also expected to continue coursework as outlined in this syllabus or other instructions on Canvas. In the event that the instructor of this course has to quarantine, this course may be taught online during that time.
